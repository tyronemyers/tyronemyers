# AI Trainer Portfolio
## Tyrone Myers

### Introduction
As an experienced AI Trainer at Data Annotation and Outlier, I have worked on a diverse range of projects aimed at improving the performance and capabilities of AI models. My primary focus has been on training AI assistants in data analysis, visualization, and advanced mathematics, as well as evaluating and refining model responses in coding, philosophy, and creative writing tasks.

Throughout my work, I have utilized my expertise in Python, SQL, R, JSON, and various markup languages to provide high-quality training data and insightful feedback. I have also leveraged my knowledge in calculus, probability, statistics, combinatorics, linear algebra, and set theory to train chatbots in advanced mathematics.

### Projects
1. **Data Science, Data Analysis in Python, and more**: Work largely from my graduate program in Data Science, including ongoing work on a Digital Humanities project employing LDA for topic modeling, ARIMA and Prophet for time series analysis, RF regression, and K-means clustering on the work of the Church Fathers.

2. **Single-Sided Instruction Following**: Evaluated model responses for adherence to user instructions and provided detailed rationales for each assessment.

3. **Compare Coding Responses**: Compared and rated model responses for coding tasks based on various criteria, including overall quality, correctness, functionality, instruction following, helpfulness, writing style, verbosity, and harmlessness. Provided explanations for issues identified and preference rationales.

4. **Compare Coding Responses and Edit**: Built upon the Compare Coding Responses project by editing model responses to significantly improve their quality and functionality.

5. **Write Prompts, Compare Coding Responses (and sometimes Edit)**: Developed prompts and reference implementations to iteratively refine model responses through multiple conversation turns and assess response quality.

6. **Evaluate Math Models**: Assessed the accuracy of model responses to advanced mathematics prompts and provided corrected responses in LaTeX formatting when necessary.

7. **Compare Responses for Data Analysis and Visualization**: Evaluated model responses for data analysis and visualization tasks by running the provided code in a local environment and comparing the results.
