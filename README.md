# Data Science Portfolio
## Tyrone Myers

### Introduction
As an experienced Software Developer - AI Trainer at Data Annotation and Outlier, I have worked on a diverse range of projects aimed at improving the performance and capabilities of AI models. My primary focus has been on training AI assistants in data analysis, visualization, advanced mathematics, as well as evaluating and refining model responses in coding, creative writing tasks, and philosophical reasoning.

Throughout my work, I have utilized my expertise in Python, SQL, R, JSON, and various markup languages to provide high-quality training data and insightful feedback. I have leveraged my knowledge in calculus, probability, statistics, combinatorics, linear algebra, and set theory to train chatbots in advanced mathematics. Additionally, my background in academic philosophy has been instrumental in developing AI models capable of nuanced ethical reasoning, logical argumentation, and handling complex philosophical concepts.
